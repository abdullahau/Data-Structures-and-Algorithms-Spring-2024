    "When an element is added to the end of a list, the time needed is $O(1)$ or $O(n)$ depending on whether the memory area reserved for the list has room for the new element or not. If there is no room, a new, bigger memory area is reserved and all the elements are copied there from the old memory area.\n",

For example, when the element count reaches 17, the new memory usage is 248 bytes and there is room for (248 - 56) / 8 = 24 elements.

For example when $n=17$, the formula evaluates to $17+⌊17/8⌋+6=25$ and the nearest multiple of 4 is 24. This means that the memory size changes approximately by the factor $9/8$ in each expansion."
