# Introduction

The [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/list/) is a collection of algorithmic programming problems.

The goal of the project is to create a comprehensive high quality problem set for learning algorithmic programming. The current collection has 300 problems, and new problems will be gradually added.

## Input and output

In all problems you should read input from standard input and write output to standard output.

## Hacking

After solving a problem, you can view the solutions by other users and try to *hack* them by giving a test case where the solution fails. Then, the new test case can be added to the test data and all submissions will be regraded.

## Books

You can use the problem set together with recent competitive programming books, listed [here](https://cses.fi/book/). The books discuss techniques and ideas that are useful when solving the problems.

## License

The license of the problem set is Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0.

## Feedback

If you have feedback on the problem set, you can send a message to ahslaaks@cs.helsinki.fi (Antti Laaksonen).
